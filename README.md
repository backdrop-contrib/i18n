#Internationalization (i18n)

This is a collection of modules to extend Backdrop core multilingual 
capabilities and be able to build full-featured multilingual sites. This 
module makes possible:

- Taxonomy translation (both, per language terms and translatable terms)
- Multilingual variables
- Multilingual blocks (control visibility per language and translate title and content)
- Language selection (when you switch the site language you'll see only the content for that language)

Documentation will be kept in the [wiki](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/i18n/wiki).
