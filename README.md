# Internationalization (i18n)
<!---
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/backdrop-contrib/i18n.svg?branch=1.x)](https://travis-ci.org/backdrop-contrib/i18n)
-->

This is a collection of modules to extend Backdrop core multilingual 
capabilities and be able to build full-featured multilingual sites. This 
module makes possible:

- Taxonomy translation (both, per language terms and translatable terms)
- Enhances node translation
- Menu (item) translation
- Field label translation
- Internationalization for (core) contact forms
- Path "translation", for instance declare different views as translations
  of each other
- Synchronize field values across translated content
- Redirect visitors to the proper translation of current page, if available


## Installation

- Install this module using the official 
  [Backdrop CMS instructions](https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules)


## Issues

Bugs and Feature requests should be reported in the 
[Issue Queue](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/i18n/issues)

## Upgrade from Drupal 7

Backdrop core took over several tasks for translations, so this module had
to go through a bigger rewrite. Although it now contains less submodules,
most of the functionality should still be available.

"Most" means, that some functionality had to be dropped or implemented
differently.

A migration path from Drupal 7 is available.

## Current Maintainers

Work is ongoing and we need help. If you're willing to test functionality
and/or provide pull requests, feel free to open an issue.
Your help is highly appreciated!
